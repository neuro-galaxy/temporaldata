**temporaldata** is a Python package for easily working with temporal data. It provides
advanced data structures and methods to work with multi-modal, multi-resolution 
time series data.

It consists of several key data structures for working with regular timeseries, irregular 
timeseries, and interval objects, and functions for storing, manipulating, and 
accessing temporal data in a flexible but compute and memory-efficient manner. **temporaldata** 
is perfectly suited for deep learning pipelines.
